The following [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) introduce the `petpy` package and how to interact with 
the Petfinder API using the library to easily extract and find data of interest.  Other notebooks include 
examples of more advanced `petpy` usage. The notebooks can also be launched interactively with 
[binder](https://mybinder.org/) by clicking the "launch binder" badge.

  - Please note the following notebook is still based on the legacy version of Petfinder and thus are not fully 
    representative of the functionality and methods of the most recent version of `petpy` and the Petfinder API. These 
    are currently being updated to reflect the new version of `petpy`.
